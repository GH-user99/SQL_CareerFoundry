## SQL for data analysts by CareerFoundry

SQL stands for structured query language; it is a language that data analysts use to manage data.

## Overview

### Project Brief: Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

### My objective as a data analyst

Help with the launch strategy for the new online video service.

### Key questions and objectives

+ What’s the average rental duration, rental rate, and replacement cost of our films?

+ What is the most common film rating and the most popular special features? 

+ Which film has the highest number of copies in our inventory?

+ Extra insights: What’s the average film length, and which release year is the most common?

+ Which 10 countries have the highest number of customers?

+ Within those countries, which 10 cities have the most customers?

+ Among those cities, who are the top 5 customers in terms of total payments?

### Context

To answer the questions posed by the different departments, I queried the data using SQL (short for structured query language).

The results of the analysis will be presented to Rockbuster management, so I’ll need to visualize the data in an easy-to-consume manner.
